While two-year like-for-like\\\" fuel sales\\ngrowth was negative at (6.4)%, this primarily reflects lower demand\\nin the first half, with fuel sales ahead of pre-pandemic levels by the\\nend of the year.\\n\\nGroup adjusted operating profit* grew by +58.9% at constant rates,\\nreflecting the strong sales performance across the retail businesses,\\na reduction in COVID-19 related costs and a return to profitability\\nin Tesco Bank. These benefits were partially offset by inflationary\\npressures in the cost base, particularly in distribution costs. Group\\nstatutory operating profit, which includes adjusting items related to\\nthe costs of historical shareholder litigation claims, grew by +65.5%.\\n\\nFinance income and finance costs reduced year-on-year primarily\\ndue to fair value remeasurement gains related to the mark-to-\\nmarket movement on inflation-linked swaps, which were a \\u00a3123m\\nbenefit this year compared to a \\u00a3(214)m charge in the prior year.\\nThe reduction in our share of profit from joint ventures and\\nassociates was principally due to profit from Tesco Underwriting\\n\\n\\n<figure>\\n</figure>\\n\\n\\nbeing recognised within Tesco Bank operating profit following its\\nfull acquisition in May. The increase in tax this year primarily reflects\\nhigher levels of both retail and Tesco Bank operating profit, in addition\\nto the revaluation of deferred tax relating to the announced change\\nin the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective 1 April 2023.\\n\\nOur adjusted diluted EPSl\\u00f8 rose by +88.8%, reflecting the increase\\nin retail and Tesco Bank operating profit and a reduction in net\\nfinance costs. We have proposed a final dividend of 7.70 pence\\nper ordinary share, taking the full-year dividend to 10.90 pence\\nper ordinary share, an increase of 19.1% year-on-year.\\n\\nNet debtlt1.00 reduced by \\u00a31.4bn year-on-year, primarily driven by\\nstrong free cash flow generation. Retail free cash flow\\\" increased\\nby \\u00a30.9bn year-on-year due to higher retail operating profits, the\\nelimination of UK pension contributions (following the \\u00a32.5bn one-off\\ncontribution last year from the Asia disposal proceeds) and a working\\ncapital benefit from higher sales. These benefits were partly offset\\nby an increase in capital expenditure.

During the year, the operating\\nprofit and EPS APMs were renamed. Profit has changed from 'Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' to 'Adjusted operating profit'. EPS has\\nchanged from 'Diluted EPS before exceptional and other Items' to 'Adjusted diluted EPS'. The definitions are unchanged. The Retall free cash flow APM was amended in order to provide a more\\nconsistent and predictable view of free cash flow generated by the Group's retal operation. 'Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' within operating profit, along with net\\npension finance costs, fair value remeasurements of financial instruments, and the tax impact of such items (below operating profit), are now called 'Adjusting Items'. The policy for determining\\nadjusting items, and the Items adjusted for, are unchanged from the prior year and hence there is no Impact on previously reported APMs.\\n\\n(b) All measures apart from Net debt are shown on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated. Further details on discontinued operations can be found in Note 7, starting on page 140.\\n\\n[c) The Group has changed its accounting policy for property buybacks In light of an evolution of accepted practice In relation to the application of IFRS 16 'Leases' to such transactions. Comparatives\\nhave been restated for this change in accounting policy (see Note 1 on page 122 for further details).\\n\\n(d) Group sales exclude VAT and fuel. Sales change shown on a comparable days basis for Central Europe.\\n\\n[e) Adjusted operating profit and Adjusted diluted EPS exclude Adjusting items as noted in footnote (a).\\n\\n(f) Net debt and Retall free cash flow exclude Tesco Bank.\\n\\n(g) The share base used in Adjusted diluted EPS In the prior year is adjusted to capture the full Impact of the share consolidation which followed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and\\nMalaysia, as if it took place at the start of the 2020/21 financial year. As such, Adjusted diluted EPS (adjusted for share consolidation) Is presented on a basis other than In accordance with\\nIAS 33. Please see page 210 for a reconciliation to Adjusted diluted EPS. Like-for-like Is a measure of growth in Group online sales and sales from stores that have been open for at least a\\nyear (at constant exchange rates, excluding VAT and fuel).\\n\\n(h) Like-for-like is a measure of growth in Group online sales and sales from stores that have been open for at least a year (at constant exchange rates, excluding VAT and fuel).\\n\\n() Capex excludes additions arising from business combinations and buybacks of properties (typically stores), as well as additions relating to decommissioning provisions and similar items.\\n\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\\\"Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\\\" -->\\n<!-- PageNumber=\\\"23\\\" -->\\n\",\n",

EPS has changed from 'Diluted EPS before exceptional and other Items' to 'Adjusted diluted EPS'. The definitions are unchanged. The Retall free cash flow APM was amended in order to provide a more consistent and predictable view of free cash flow generated by the Group's retal operation. 'Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' within operating profit, along with net pension finance costs, fair value remeasurements of financial instruments, and the tax impact of such items (below operating profit), are now called 'Adjusting Items'. The policy for determining adjusting items, and the Items adjusted for, are unchanged from the prior year and hence there is no Impact on previously reported APMs.\",\n",

Profit has changed from 'Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' to 'Adjusted operating profit'. EPS has changed from 'Diluted EPS before exceptional and other Items' to 'Adjusted diluted EPS'. The definitions are unchanged. The Retall free cash flow APM was amended in order to provide a more consistent and predictable view of free cash flow generated by the Group's retal operation. 'Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' within operating profit, along with net pension finance costs, fair value remeasurements of financial instruments, and the tax impact of such items (below operating profit), are now called 'Adjusting Items'. The policy for determining adjusting items, and the Items adjusted for, are unchanged from the prior year and hence there is no Impact on previously reported APMs.\",\n",

While two-year like-for-like\" fuel sales\\ngrowth was negative at (6.4)%, this primarily reflects lower demand\\nin the first half, with fuel sales ahead of pre-pandemic levels by the\\nend of the year.\\n\\nGroup adjusted operating profit* grew by +58.9% at constant rates,\\nreflecting the strong sales performance across the retail businesses,\\na reduction in COVID-19 related costs and a return to profitability\\nin Tesco Bank. These benefits were partially offset by inflationary\\npressures in the cost base, particularly in distribution costs. Group\\nstatutory operating profit, which includes adjusting items related to\\nthe costs of historical shareholder litigation claims, grew by +65.5%.\\n\\nFinance income and finance costs reduced year-on-year primarily\\ndue to fair value remeasurement gains related to the mark-to-\\nmarket movement on inflation-linked swaps, which were a £123m\\nbenefit this year compared to a £(214)m charge in the prior year.\\nThe reduction in our share of profit from joint ventures and\\nassociates was principally due to profit from Tesco Underwriting\\n\\n\\n<figure>\\n</figure>\\n\\n\\nbeing recognised within Tesco Bank operating profit following its\\nfull acquisition in May. The increase in tax this year primarily reflects\\nhigher levels of both retail and Tesco Bank operating profit, in addition\\nto the revaluation of deferred tax relating to the announced change\\nin the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective 1 April 2023.\\n\\nOur adjusted diluted EPSlø rose by +88.8%, reflecting the increase\\nin retail and Tesco Bank operating profit and a reduction in net\\nfinance costs. We have proposed a final dividend of 7.70 pence\\nper ordinary share, taking the full-year dividend to 10.90 pence\\nper ordinary share, an increase of 19.1% year-on-year.\\n\\nNet debtlt1.00 reduced by £1.4bn year-on-year, primarily driven by\\nstrong free cash flow generation. Retail free cash flow\" increased\\nby £0.9bn year-on-year due to higher retail operating profits, the\\nelimination of UK pension contributions (following the £2.5bn one-off\\ncontribution last year from the Asia disposal proceeds) and a working\\ncapital benefit from higher sales. These benefits were partly offset\\nby an increase in capital expenditure. The Net debt/EBITDA ratio was\\n2.5 times at the year end, compared to 3.3 times last year.\\n\\nFurther commentary on all of these metrics can be found below and\\na full income statement can be found on page 116.\\n\\n\\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th rowspan=\"2\">52 weeks ended 26 February 202221</th>\\n<th rowspan=\"2\">FY 2021/22</th>\\n<th rowspan=\"2\">FY0 2020/21</th>\\n<th colspan=\"2\">Total change YoY</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Actual rate</th>\\n<th>Constant rate</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Group sales (exc.

During the year, the operating\\nprofit and EPS APMs were renamed. Profit has changed from \\'Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles\\' to \\'Adjusted operating profit\\'. EPS has\\nchanged from \\'Diluted EPS before exceptional and other Items\\' to \\'Adjusted diluted EPS\\'. The definitions are unchanged. The Retall free cash flow APM was amended in order to provide a more\\nconsistent and predictable view of free cash flow generated by the Group\\'s retal operation. \\'Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles\\' within operating profit, along with net\\npension finance costs, fair value remeasurements of financial instruments, and the tax impact of such items (below operating profit), are now called \\'Adjusting Items\\'. The policy for determining\\nadjusting items, and the Items adjusted for, are unchanged from the prior year and hence there is no Impact on previously reported APMs.\\n\\n(b) All measures apart from Net debt are shown on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated. Further details on discontinued operations can be found in Note 7, starting on page 140.\\n\\n[c) The Group has changed its accounting policy for property buybacks In light of an evolution of accepted practice In relation to the application of IFRS 16 \\'Leases\\' to such transactions. Comparatives\\nhave been restated for this change in accounting policy (see Note 1 on page 122 for further details).\\n\\n(d) Group sales exclude VAT and fuel. Sales change shown on a comparable days basis for Central Europe.\\n\\n[e) Adjusted operating profit and Adjusted diluted EPS exclude Adjusting items as noted in footnote (a).\\n\\n(f) Net debt and Retall free cash flow exclude Tesco Bank.\\n\\n(g) The share base used in Adjusted diluted EPS In the prior year is adjusted to capture the full Impact of the share consolidation which followed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and\\nMalaysia, as if it took place at the start of the 2020/21 financial year. As such, Adjusted diluted EPS (adjusted for share consolidation) Is presented on a basis other than In accordance with\\nIAS 33. Please see page 210 for a reconciliation to Adjusted diluted EPS. Like-for-like Is a measure of growth in Group online sales and sales from stores that have been open for at least a\\nyear (at constant exchange rates, excluding VAT and fuel).\\n\\n(h) Like-for-like is a measure of growth in Group online sales and sales from stores that have been open for at least a year (at constant exchange rates, excluding VAT and fuel).\\n\\n() Capex excludes additions arising from business combinations and buybacks of properties (typically stores), as well as additions relating to decommissioning provisions and similar items.\\n\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022\" -->\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"23\" -->\\n',\n",

EPS has changed from 'Diluted EPS before exceptional and other Items' to 'Adjusted diluted EPS'. The definitions are unchanged. The Retall free cash flow APM was amended in order to provide a more consistent and predictable view of free cash flow generated by the Group's retal operation. 'Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' within operating profit, along with net pension finance costs, fair value remeasurements of financial instruments, and the tax impact of such items (below operating profit), are now called 'Adjusting Items'.

Profit has changed from 'Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' to 'Adjusted operating profit'. EPS has changed from 'Diluted EPS before exceptional and other Items' to 'Adjusted diluted EPS'. The definitions are unchanged. The Retall free cash flow APM was amended in order to provide a more consistent and predictable view of free cash flow generated by the Group's retal operation. 'Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles' within operating profit, along with net pension finance costs, fair value remeasurements of financial instruments, and the tax impact of such items (below operating profit), are now called 'Adjusting Items'. The policy for determining adjusting items, and the Items adjusted for, are unchanged from the prior year and hence there is no Impact on previously reported APMs.\",\n",

While two-year like-for-like\" fuel sales\\ngrowth was negative at (6.4)%, this primarily reflects lower demand\\nin the first half, with fuel sales ahead of pre-pandemic levels by the\\nend of the year.\\n\\nGroup adjusted operating profit* grew by +58.9% at constant rates,\\nreflecting the strong sales performance across the retail businesses,\\na reduction in COVID-19 related costs and a return to profitability\\nin Tesco Bank. These benefits were partially offset by inflationary\\npressures in the cost base, particularly in distribution costs. Group\\nstatutory operating profit, which includes adjusting items related to\\nthe costs of historical shareholder litigation claims, grew by +65.5%.\\n\\nFinance income and finance costs reduced year-on-year primarily\\ndue to fair value remeasurement gains related to the mark-to-\\nmarket movement on inflation-linked swaps, which were a £123m\\nbenefit this year compared to a £(214)m charge in the prior year.\\nThe reduction in our share of profit from joint ventures and\\nassociates was principally due to profit from Tesco Underwriting\\n\\n\\n<figure>\\n</figure>\\n\\n\\nbeing recognised within Tesco Bank operating profit following its\\nfull acquisition in May. The increase in tax this year primarily reflects\\nhigher levels of both retail and Tesco Bank operating profit, in addition\\nto the revaluation of deferred tax relating to the announced change\\nin the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective 1 April 2023.\\n\\nOur adjusted diluted EPSlø rose by +88.8%, reflecting the increase\\nin retail and Tesco Bank operating profit and a reduction in net\\nfinance costs. We have proposed a final dividend of 7.70 pence\\nper ordinary share, taking the full-year dividend to 10.90 pence\\nper ordinary share, an increase of 19.1% year-on-year.\\n\\nNet debtlt1.00 reduced by £1.4bn year-on-year, primarily driven by\\nstrong free cash flow generation. Retail free cash flow\" increased\\nby £0.9bn year-on-year due to higher retail operating profits, the\\nelimination of UK pension contributions (following the £2.5bn one-off\\ncontribution last year from the Asia disposal proceeds) and a working\\ncapital benefit from higher sales. These benefits were partly offset\\nby an increase in capital expenditure. The Net debt/EBITDA ratio was\\n2.5 times at the year end, compared to 3.3 times last year.\\n\\nFurther commentary on all of these metrics can be found below and\\na full income statement can be found on page 116.\\n\\n\\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th rowspan=\"2\">52 weeks ended 26 February 202221</th>\\n<th rowspan=\"2\">FY 2021/22</th>\\n<th rowspan=\"2\">FY0 2020/21</th>\\n<th colspan=\"2\">Total change YoY</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Actual rate</th>\\n<th>Constant rate</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Group sales (exc.

During the year, the operating\\nprofit and EPS APMs were renamed. Profit has changed from \\'Group operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles\\' to \\'Adjusted operating profit\\'. EPS has\\nchanged from \\'Diluted EPS before exceptional and other Items\\' to \\'Adjusted diluted EPS\\'. The definitions are unchanged. The Retall free cash flow APM was amended in order to provide a more\\nconsistent and predictable view of free cash flow generated by the Group\\'s retal operation. \\'Exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles\\' within operating profit, along with net\\npension finance costs, fair value remeasurements of financial instruments, and the tax impact of such items (below operating profit), are now called \\'Adjusting Items\\'. The policy for determining\\nadjusting items, and the Items adjusted for, are unchanged from the prior year and hence there is no Impact on previously reported APMs.\\n\\n(b) All measures apart from Net debt are shown on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise stated. Further details on discontinued operations can be found in Note 7, starting on page 140.\\n\\n[c) The Group has changed its accounting policy for property buybacks In light of an evolution of accepted practice In relation to the application of IFRS 16 \\'Leases\\' to such transactions. Comparatives\\nhave been restated for this change in accounting policy (see Note 1 on page 122 for further details).\\n\\n(d) Group sales exclude VAT and fuel. Sales change shown on a comparable days basis for Central Europe.\\n\\n[e) Adjusted operating profit and Adjusted diluted EPS exclude Adjusting items as noted in footnote (a).\\n\\n(f) Net debt and Retall free cash flow exclude Tesco Bank.\\n\\n(g) The share base used in Adjusted diluted EPS In the prior year is adjusted to capture the full Impact of the share consolidation which followed the sale of our businesses in Thailand and\\nMalaysia, as if it took place at the start of the 2020/21 financial year. As such, Adjusted diluted EPS (adjusted for share consolidation) Is presented on a basis other than In accordance with\\nIAS 33. Please see page 210 for a reconciliation to Adjusted diluted EPS. Like-for-like Is a measure of growth in Group online sales and sales from stores that have been open for at least a\\nyear (at constant exchange rates, excluding VAT and fuel).\\n\\n(h) Like-for-like is a measure of growth in Group online sales and sales from stores that have been open for at least a year (at constant exchange rates, excluding VAT and fuel).\\n\\n() Capex excludes additions arising from business combinations and buybacks of properties (typically stores), as well as additions relating to decommissioning provisions and similar items.\\n\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Tesco PLC
