      "1. **Cash: -85.96%**\n",

      "2. **Marketable Securities: -45.41%**\n",
      "   - Root Cause: Indicates reduction in short-term investments, possibly to fund operations, pay down debt, or respond to volatility in market returns. May also relate to increased working capital needs amid cost-of-living pressures or supply chain disruptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Accounts Receivable: -56.19%**\n",
      "   - Root Cause: Significant decrease could indicate tighter credit policies, faster customer collections, or a reduction in non-retail (B2B/wholesale) activities. May also be affected by divestments or changes in business/customer mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Accounts Payable: -100.83%**\n",
      "   - Root Cause: An apparent shift from large payables to a small or negative balance likely signals accelerated payments to suppliers, renegotiated payment terms, or changes in supplier relationships due to risk mitigation or inflationary supply chain challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Total Debt: -198.25%**\n",
      "   - Root Cause: Suggests substantial deleveraging, possibly through major debt repayments, refinancing, or even reclassification of debt/equity due to changes in IFRS/accounting policy. May indicate strong cash flow deployment targeting lower interest expense and risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **COGS: -228.67%**\n",

      "\n",
      "7. **Depreciation: -47.12%**\n",

      "\n",
      "9. **Inventory: +4.85%**\n",
